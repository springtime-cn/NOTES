step1: unable the nouveau driver

	sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
	添加：
	blacklist nouveau
	options nouveau modeset=0
	The Nouveau drivers are loaded if the following command prints anything:
	$ lsmod | grep nouveau

	Regenerate the kernel initramfs:
	$ sudo update-initramfs -u

	You will need to reboot your system after adding these configuration directives in order for them to take effect.

step2: disable the x-window
	service gdm stop
	sudo systemctl disable lightdm.service
	This will prevent the service from starting at boot.

	sudo systemctl restart lightdm.service, OK.
	sudo service lightdm restart
	sudo service lightdm start

step3: install driver
	-A, --advanced-options
      Print usage information for the common commandline options
      as well as the advanced options, and then exit.
	--uninstall
      Uninstall the currently installed NVIDIA driver.
      When uninstalling the driver, skip unloading of the NVIDIA
      uninstalled.  This option causes the installer to simply
      Install a kernel module only, and do not uninstall the
      /usr/lib/nvidia before and after installing or uninstalling

	--no-opengl-libs
	when you have integrated gpu and only want to use it, add this option.

step4: configure the xorg.conf
	
	im my instance, nvidia-smi, it prints xorg 5Mib. and this is OK.

step5: install cuda runfile and cudnn

	don't forget the 'no opengl' option

Done
